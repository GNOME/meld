Meld's icon situation is an unfortunate confusion of legacy and new-ish
icons.

All of the icons in the top-level icon folder should be considered
legacy. Some, like the VC actions, should be replaced with modern, symbolic
alternatives. Others, like the filter icons, should probably be removed and
their respective UI elements reworked.

Icons in the hicolor folder are more recently updated, and mostly follow
the spec.


Application icons
=================

 * The reference icon is the SVG at hicolor/scalable/apps/org.gnome.meld.svg.
   It is designed on a 128x128 canvas and scales fairly well to higher
   resolutions.


Action icons
============

The change action icons in hicolor/16x16/actions are all used and have been
recently updated. These are extremely simple icons, but we would ideally have
these at additional sizes for different file comparison line heights.
